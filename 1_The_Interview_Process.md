# The Interview Process
: Assesment of performence, usually based on the following
1. Analytical skills
- Did you need much help solving problem?
- How optimal was your solution?
- How long did it take you to arrive at a solution?

2. Coding skills
- Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
- Was it clean and well-organized?
- Did you think about potential errors?

3. Technical knowledge/ Computer Science fundamentals
- Do you have a strong foundation in CS and the relevant technologies?

4. Experience
- Have you made good technical decisions in the past?

## Why?
: Why do things this way? On the following reasons can explain why.


### False negatives are acceptable
(**False negative** : An error in which a test result is negative(false), when in reality it is positive(true) )
: From the company's perspective, it's actually acceptable that some good candidates are rejected. The company is out to buld a great set of employees. They can accept that they miss out on some good people.  
They're far more concerned with false positive(<-> false negative): people who do well in an interview but are not in fact very good

### Problem-solving skills are valuable
: If you're able to work through several hard problems, you're probably pretty good at developing optimal algorithms. 

### Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful

### Whiteboards let you focus on what matters
: The nice thing aboud a whiteboard is that, in some ways, you can focus on the big picture.  
You don't have a compiler, so you don't need to make your code compile.  
You don't need to write the entire class definition and boilerplate code.  
You get to focus on the interesting, "meaty" parts of the code : the function that the question is reallu all about
Whiteboards also tend to encourage candidates to speak more and explain their thought process. 

### But it's not for everyone or every company or every situation

## How Questions are Selected
: At the vast majority of companies, there are no lists of what interviewers should ask. Rather, each interviewer selects their own questions.  
But within a given category of question, there is little that makes it "belong" to one company instead of another. A Google algorithm is essentially the same as a Facebook algorithm question


## It's All Relative
: Interviewers assess you relative to other candidates on that same question by the same interviwers . It's a relative comparision.  
Your interviewer develops a feel for your performance by comparing you to other people.   
It's not about the candidates she's interviewing that week. It's about all the candidates that she's ever asked this question to.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### I didn't hear back immediately after my interview. Am I rejected?
: No. Ther are a number of reasons why a company's decision might be delayed.   
If you haven't heard back from a company within 2-5 business days after your interview, check in politely with your recruiter.

### Can I re-apply to a company getting rejected?
: Almost always, but you typically have to wait a bit(6 months to a 1 year)
